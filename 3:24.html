       <h1>WHO IS BINGBINAKI?</h1>
       <p>words can't express how beautiful she is, she is be best, she is beautiful from inside to outside. she is kind, she is smart. no one is perfect but she is!!!</P>
       <p>William Shakespeare:<br>My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red than her lips' red;<br>If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.<br>I have seen roses damask'd, red and white, but no such roses see I in her cheeks;<br>And in some perfumes is there more delight than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.<br>I love to hear her speak, yet well I know that music hath a far more pleasing sound;<br>I grant I never saw a goddess go; My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:<br>And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare as any she belied with false compare.
